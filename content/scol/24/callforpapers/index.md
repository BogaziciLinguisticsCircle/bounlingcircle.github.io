# Call For Papers

The 6th Annual Meeting of Boğaziçi University Student Conference on Linguistics (SCOL’24) 

**Submission deadline:** February 1, 2024
 
We are pleased to announce the 6th annual edition of Boğaziçi University Student Conference on Linguistics (SCOL)! 
Formerly known as BUSCTEL, Boğaziçi SCOL aims to gather graduate and undergraduate students in Linguistics from all over the  world at a conference in the world-famous transcontinental metropolis, Istanbul. Ever since 2018, thanks to our  organization team’s undying passion and unyielding diligence in their efforts, each year we enrich our catalogue of  research projects, broaden the visions of our attendees, and house more and more guests from around the globe.

SCOL invites abstracts in any area of linguistic research, including but not limited to syntax, morphology, semantics,  pragmatics, sociolinguistics, phonology, phonetics, typology, computational syntax/semantics and all relevant interfaces and related fields in cognitive/social sciences. If you are an aspiring linguist or interested in the aforementioned fields, submit an abstract to join us in our linguistic venture! 

The official language of the conference is English. Submissions are open for 30-minute talks (20-minute talk + 10 minutes for discussion) and posters. 

All graduate and undergraduate students are welcome to submit an abstract via our Oxford Abstracts platform [here](https://app.oxfordabstracts.com/stages/12530/submitter)
