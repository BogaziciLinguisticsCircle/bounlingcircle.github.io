# Student Conference on Linguistics 2025 (SCOL'25)

Welcome! The 7th annual SCOL (formerly known as BUSCTEL) will take place this spring at Boğaziçi University. 

Stay tuned for our call for papers! 

**Keynote speakers:** 

_TBA_


SCOL is an annual conference that includes all aspects of linguistic research. Once again, we hope to include presentations and posters by students from other departments and other universities. Our aim is to create an environment in which students studying in similar fields can exchange ideas and experiences.
