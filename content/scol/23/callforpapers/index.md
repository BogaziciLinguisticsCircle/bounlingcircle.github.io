## Abstract guidelines

Abstracts should contain original research that, at the time of submission, has neither been published nor accepted for publication. It may be presented in other conferences. Please bear in mind that a good abstract **may, but need not** contain a fully worked out solution. One person can submit at most two abstracts only one of which can be single-authored. Abstracts must be submitted electronically in PDF format. **Submissions should be anonymous** and not reveal the identity of the author(s) in any form (e.g., references, file name or properties of the abstract). Abstracts must **not exceed two pages** in letter-size or A4 paper, including examples and references, with 2.5 cm (or 1 inch) margins on all sides and 11 point font size.

Abstract, talks, and posters must be in English. 

All questions and comments should be addressed to [scol at boun.edu.tr][mail].
