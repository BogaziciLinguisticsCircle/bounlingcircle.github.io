SCOL is an annual conference that includes all aspects of linguistic research. Once again, we hope to include presentations and posters by students from other departments, as well as other universities, and to create an environment in which students studying in similar fields at different universities can exchange ideas and experiences. SCOL'22 drew more than 100 participants, hosted 15 speakers, and received submissions from 13 countries.
