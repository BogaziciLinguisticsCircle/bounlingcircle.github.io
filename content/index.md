# Boğaziçi University Student Conference on Linguistics

The **Boğaziçi University Student Conference (SCOL)** (formerly known as BUSCTEL) is an annual conference that includes all aspects of linguistic research, an initiative affiliated with Bogazici University, the Department of Linguistics.  We hope to include presentations and posters by students from other departments and other universities. Our aim is to coordinate, host and participate in a scholarly environment in which students studying in similar fields can exchange ideas and experiences.
<br/>
**SCOL** started as an initiative to expand the scope of informal talk series by BLC (Boğaziçi Linguistics Circle) and to include students from other departments as well as other universities in 2018, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the linguistics program at Boğaziçi University. We are organizing **[7th SCOL][scol_recent]** this year and hope to see you all in person!
<br />
**Thank you very much for your interest in SCOL 2024.**
