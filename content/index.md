# Bogazici University Linguistics Circle

The **Bogazici Linguistics Circle (BLC)** is a student-run association affiliated with Bogazici University, the Department of Linguistics. BLC aims to coordinate, host, and participate in scholarly discussions with early-career researchers that are undergrad and master’s students. In addition to the annual BOUN Student Conference on Linguistics (**SCOL**, formerly known as BUSCTEL), BLC hosts informal talks on various subfields of linguistics. 

<br />

**[SCOL][scol_recent]** started as an initiative to expand the scope of informal talk series and to include students from other departments as well as other universities on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the linguistics program at Boğaziçi University. We are organizing **[7th SCOL][scol_recent]** this year and hope to see you all in person!

<br />

**We are currently accepting submissions for SCOL 2025!** 

SCOL 2025 will be held May 6-7, 2025, at Albert Long Hall, Boğaziçi University South Campus.
